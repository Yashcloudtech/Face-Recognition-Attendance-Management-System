# Face-recognition-attendance-management-system

This project aims to develop a face recognition attendance management system. The system will utilize facial recognition technology to automate the attendance marking process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. By leveraging facial recognition algorithms, the system will identify individuals and record their attendance, providing a seamless and reliable solution for attendance management.

The Face Recognition Attendance Management System is designed to automate and streamline the process of recording attendance in educational institutions or corporate settings. The system utilizes facial recognition technology to accurately identify individuals and record their attendance in real-time.

# The system will include features such as:

*	Facial recognition for attendance tracking.

* Attendance reporting and analytics.

* Integration with existing databases or systems.

# PROJECT STRUCTURE: 

* After run you need to give your face data to system so enter your ID and name in box than click on Take Images button.

*	It will collect 200 images of your faces; it saves a image in Training Image folder
*	After that we need to train a model (for train a model click on Train Image button.

*	It will take 5-10 minutes for training (for 10 person data).

* Manually Fill Attendance Button in UI is for fill a manually attendance (without face recognition),it's also create a .csv and store in a database.

# CONSTRAINTS: -

* The accuracy of facial recognition may be affected by factors such as lighting conditions, facial expressions, and occlusions.

* The system's performance may vary based on the hardware specifications and network connectivity.
